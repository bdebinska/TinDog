# TinDog

Website for TinDog - a fictional knockoff of Tinder app. Made while completing sections 7 and 8 of The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy, using Bootstrap.

I used this project to learn Bootstrap and get more practice in HTML and CSS.

For anyone that starts to learn how to code, I recomend taking this course on https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/.
